# HO-HyperRank
Higher-Order HyperRank (HR) is a hypergraph centrality measure I developed as an independent research project for my Network Science course in fall of 2020. HR is a generalization of the PageRank algorithm which takes _hypergraph motif_ participation into account when determining node importance. To see the full details, check out the [project report](https://github.com/joshua-matt/HO-HyperRank/Project_Report.pdf).

## Data
The dataset used for this project is the Enron email dataset, courtesy of [Austin R. Benson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/email-Enron/).
